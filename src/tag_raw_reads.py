"""
This file aggregates and tags the known assembled transcriptomes.

Input: A directory containing FASTA files. Each FASTA file's name has a sample ID in it.

Sample IDs 1-11 are from lane 1. Sample IDs 12-22 are from lane 2. 

Output 1: A directory containing tagged fasta files 

Output 2: A single FASTA file with all the sequences from the directory. Samples are tagged with both lane ID and sample ID
